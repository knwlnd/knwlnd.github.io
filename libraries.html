<h2 id='libraries'>Block Libraries</h2>
        <h3>Amp Blocks</h3>
        <p>In the Amplifier Blocks where there are more than 4 channels or it made sense to me to spread the complete amp across two blocks they are labelled "amp name 1" and "amp name 2" and when used together will cover all the channels. <br>
        Where there are alternate configurations of the channels of one amp they are named "amp name A" "amp name B".<br><br>
All amps are set to thru bypass so they can be used inline as opposed to in parallel, this is just a personal preference and because I use the same amp block library with the FM3 and at times use no amp or a drive block (FET Preamp) to create a clean thus keeping 4 amp channels for other sounds.<br><br>
There may also be control switches assigned for amp functions like boost or saturation, these are highlighted by the yellow dot on the parameter in Axe-Edit, just un-assign if it's not helpful..</p>

        <h3>Cab Blocks</h3>
        <p>Generally set up in pairs as I found I rarely use more than 2 IR's, if other IR's are included for a given cab they are added to slots 3 and 4 and are muted.<br>

The alternatives are iterated through, for example;<br>
<br>
Marshall 2x12 '71 Oversize A is a 57 and a 121<br>
Marshall 2x12 '71 Oversize B is a different 57 and a 121<br>
Marshall 2x12 '71 Oversize C is a 421 and a 121<br>
Marshall 2x12 '71 Oversize D is a 421 and a 160<br>
<br>
This allows me to quickly search a cab name or speaker such as Marshall then pin the selection window and move through lots of iterations quickly.</p>
